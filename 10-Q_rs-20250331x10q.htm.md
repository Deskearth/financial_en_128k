**NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

​

**Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**

​

**Principles of Consolidation**

​

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Reliance, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively “Reliance”, the “Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”). These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions of Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all material adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for presentation of financial statements for interim periods in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full year. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The ownership of the other interest holders of consolidated subsidiaries is reflected as noncontrolling interests. Investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries are recorded under the equity method of accounting. These consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Reliance’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.

​

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

​

**Inventories**

​

The majority of our inventory is valued using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method, which is not in excess of market. Under this method, older costs are included in inventory, which may be higher or lower than current costs. We estimate the effect of LIFO on interim periods by allocating the projected year-end LIFO calculation to interim periods on a pro rata basis. 

​

**Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards—Not Yet Adopted**

​

 _Improvement to Income Tax Disclosures_ —In December 2023, the FASB issued changes to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes. The changes require disaggregated information about our effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. These changes are effective for our annual periods beginning in our 2025 fiscal year. As the guidance only requires additional disclosure, there will be no impact to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

​

 _Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses_ —In November 2024, the FASB issued changes to expand the disclosure requirements for specific expense categories. The changes require disaggregated quantitative disclosure, in the notes to the financial statements, of prescribed expense categories included within relevant income statement expense captions. These changes will be effective beginning with our 2027 fiscal year and subsequent interim periods, with early adoption permitted. As the guidance only requires additional disclosure, there will be no impact to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

​

**2024 Acquisitions**

​

We acquired each of Cooksey Iron & Metal Company on February 1, 2024; American Alloy Steel, Inc. and Mid-West Materials, Inc. on April 1, 2024; and certain assets of the FerrouSouth division of Ferragon Corporation on August 16,

2024, with cash on hand. Included in our net sales for the first quarters of 2025 and 2024 were combined net sales of $99.4 million and $16.1 million, respectively, from our 2024 acquisitions.

​

Our 2024 acquisitions have increased our capacity and enhanced our product, customer and geographic diversification. We have not diversified outside our core business of providing metal distribution and processing solutions since inception.

​

The aggregate allocation of the purchase prices for our 2024 acquisitions to the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was as follows:

**Summary purchase price allocation information for all acquisitions**

​

All of the acquisitions discussed in this note have been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, each purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values at the date of each acquisition. The accompanying consolidated statements of income include the revenues and expenses of each acquisition since its respective acquisition date. The consolidated balance sheets reflect the allocations of each acquisition’s purchase price as of March 31, 2025. The measurement periods for purchase price allocations do not exceed 12 months from the acquisition date.

​

As part of the purchase price allocations for the 2024 acquisitions, we allocated $41.4 million to the trade names acquired. We determined that each of the trade names acquired in connection with these acquisitions had indefinite lives since their economic lives are expected to approximate the life of each company acquired. We recorded other identifiable intangible assets related to customer relationships for the 2024 acquisitions of $39.3 million with weighted average lives of 13.1 years and non-compete agreements of $0.2 million with lives of 5.0 years. The goodwill arising from our 2024 acquisitions predominantly consists of expected strategic benefits, including enhanced financial and operational scale, as well as expansion of acquired product and processing know-how across our enterprise. Goodwill of $35.1 million from our 2024 acquisitions is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

​

**Pro forma financial information for all acquisitions**

​

Pro forma financial results reflect our consolidated results of operations as if our 2024 acquisitions had occurred as of January 1, 2023, after the effect of certain adjustments, including lease cost fair value adjustments, amortization of inventory step-down to fair value adjustments included in cost of sales, depreciation and amortization of certain identifiable property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Pro forma results for the first quarter of 2024 have been provided for comparative purposes only and are not indicative of what would have occurred had the 2024 acquisitions been made as of January 1, 2023 or of any potential results which may occur in the future.

​

**Unsecured Credit Facility**

​

On September 10, 2024, we entered into a $1.5 billion unsecured five-year Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (“Credit Agreement”) that amended and restated our then-existing $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. As of March 31, 2025, borrowings under the Credit Agreement were available at variable rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus 1.00% or the bank prime rate and we currently pay a commitment fee at an annual rate of 0.10% on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility. The applicable margins over SOFR and base rate borrowings, along with commitment fees, are subject to adjustment every quarter based on our total net leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. All borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be prepaid without penalty.

​

The weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facility was 5.35% as of March 31, 2025. We had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2024. We had $1.1 million of letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. 

​

**Senior Unsecured Notes**

​

Under the indentures for each series of our senior notes (the “indentures”), the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. If we experience a change in control accompanied by a downgrade in our credit rating, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase each series of the notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.

​

**Letter of Credit/Letters of Guarantee Facility**

​

We have a $50.0 million standby letters of credit/letters of guarantee agreement with one of the lenders under our Credit Agreement. A total of $29.2 million were outstanding under this facility as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.

​

**Covenants**

​

The Credit Agreement and the indentures include customary representations, warranties, covenants and events of default provisions. The covenants under the Credit Agreement include, among other things, a financial maintenance

covenant that requires us to comply with a maximum total net leverage ratio. We were in compliance with the financial maintenance covenant in our Credit Agreement as of March 31, 2025.

**Note 9. Income Taxes**

​

Our effective income tax rates for the first quarters of 2025 and 2024 were 23.6% and 23.3%, respectively. The differences between our effective income tax rates and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0% were mainly due to state income taxes.

**Note 10. Equity**

​

**Stock-Based Compensation Plans**

​

We make annual grants of long-term equity incentive awards to officers and key employees in the forms of service-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”) that each have approximately 3-year vesting periods. Each PSU includes the right to receive, based on a sliding scale, up to a maximum of two shares of our common stock for each vested PSU, that is tied to achieving a return on assets target over a 3-year measurement period and continued service. We also grant the non-management members of our Board of Directors fully vested stock awards. The fair values of the RSUs, PSUs and stock awards are determined based on the closing stock price of our common stock on the grant date.

​

A summary of the status of our unvested RSUs and PSUs as of March 31, 2025 and changes during the first quarter of 2025 is as follows:

​

​

As of March 31, 2025, there was $94.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs and PSUs that is expected to be recognized, net of actual forfeitures and cancellations, over a weighted average period of 2.0 years.

​

**Common Stock**

​

We have paid regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock for 66 consecutive years. Our Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend from $1.00 per share to $1.10 per share in February 2024 and to $1.20 per share in February 2025. The holders of Reliance common stock are entitled to one vote per share on each matter submitted to a vote of stockholders.

​

On April 21, 2025, our Board of Directors declared the 2025 second quarter cash dividend of $1.20 per share of common stock, payable on June 6, 2025 to stockholders of record as of May 23, 2025.

​

**Share Repurchases**

​

On October 22, 2024, our Board of Directors amended our share repurchase program to replenish the repurchase authorization to $1.5 billion. The share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares, does not have a specific expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Repurchased and subsequently retired shares are restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares.

​

In the first quarter of 2025, we repurchased 922,656 shares at an average cost per share of $274.41 for a total of $253.2 million. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in the first quarter of 2024.

​

Our share repurchase amounts exclude related excise tax and shares withheld related to net share settlements upon the vesting of RSUs and PSUs to settle employees’ tax withholding obligations of $11.5 million and $23.9 million in the first quarters of 2025 and 2024, respectively.

​

Subsequent to quarter end, we repurchased an additional 301,279 shares at an average cost of $265.17, for a total of $79.9 million, resulting in $1.02 billion remaining available for repurchase as of April 25, 2025.

​

Foreign currency translation adjustments have not been adjusted for income taxes. Pension and postretirement benefit plan adjustments are net of deferred tax liabilities of $1.0 million as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. Pension and postretirement benefit plan adjustments are amortized over service periods and reflected in the amortization of net loss component of our net periodic benefit cost or recognized as a non-operating gain or loss as result of plan settlements. As our pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations are settled, the related income tax effect is released from accumulated other comprehensive loss and included in our income tax provision. 

​

**Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies**

​

**Environmental Contingencies**

​

We are currently involved with an environmental remediation project related to activities at former manufacturing operations of Earle M. Jorgensen Company (“EMJ”), our wholly owned subsidiary, that were sold many years prior to our acquisition of EMJ in 2006. Although the potential cleanup costs could be significant, EMJ maintained insurance policies during the time it owned the manufacturing operations that have covered costs incurred to date and are expected to continue to cover the majority of the related costs. We do not expect that this obligation will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

​

**Legal Matters**

​

From time to time, we are named as a defendant in legal actions. These actions generally arise in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently a party to any pending legal proceedings other than routine litigation incidental to the business. We expect that these matters will be resolved without having a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We maintain general liability insurance against risks arising in the ordinary course of business.

​

The terms “Company,” “Reliance,” “we,” “our,” and “us” refer to Reliance, Inc. and all its subsidiaries that are consolidated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, unless otherwise indicated.

​

This report contains certain statements that are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Our forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, discussions of our industry and end markets, business strategies, acquisitions, and expectations concerning our future growth and profitability and our ability to generate industry leading returns for our stockholders, as well as future demand and metals pricing and our results of operations, margins, profitability, taxes, liquidity, macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, and the possibility of an economic recession or slowdown, litigation matters and capital resources. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “preliminary,” “range,” “intend” and “continue,” the negative of these terms, and similar expressions. All statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s estimates, projections and assumptions as of the date of such statements. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.

​

Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including, but not limited to, actions taken by us, as well as developments beyond our control, including, but not limited to, changes in domestic and worldwide political and economic conditions due to, among other factors, U.S. and foreign trade policies and the impact on economic conditions, inflation and the increasing likelihood of an economic recession that could materially impact us, our customers and suppliers, metals pricing, and demand for our products and services; U.S. and foreign trade policies affecting metals product markets and pricing specifically; the possibility that the expected benefits of acquisitions and capital expenditures may not materialize as expected; and the impacts of labor constraints and supply chain disruptions. Deteriorations in economic conditions as a result of tariffs or trade barriers, economic policies, inflation, economic recession, slowing growth, outbreaks of infectious disease, or geopolitical conflicts such as in Ukraine and the Middle East, could lead to a decline in demand for our products and services and negatively impact our business, and may also impact financial markets and corporate credit markets which could adversely impact our access to financing, or the terms of any financing. Other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements include those disclosed in this report and in other reports we have filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Important risks and uncertainties about our business can be found elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 filed with the SEC and in other documents Reliance files or furnishes with the SEC. The Company cannot at this time predict all of the impacts of domestic and foreign tariffs and trade policies, inflation, product price fluctuations, economic recession, outbreaks of infectious disease, geopolitical conflicts and related economic effects, but these factors, individually or in any combination, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

​

The statements contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q speak only as of the date that they were made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law. Except as required by law, we disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in assumptions, beliefs, or expectations or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances upon which any such forward-looking statements are based. You should review any additional disclosures we make in any subsequent press releases and Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filed with or furnished to the SEC.

**Overview**

​

Underlying demand in the first quarter of 2025 was healthy in the majority of our end markets, most notably in non-residential construction, despite ongoing uncertainty in both domestic and international economic policy. Our tons sold were a record in the first quarter of 2025, however our operating results declined year-over-year, mainly due to lower metals prices and gross profit margin. The declining metals pricing trend we experienced throughout 2024 and into February 2025 reversed with strong metals pricing increases throughout March that held into April. 

​

Our tons sold in the first quarter of 2025 increased 9% year-over-year, reaching a new record of 1.63 million tons, supported by solid organic growth and contributions from our 2024 acquisitions. We believe our shipments also benefited from our long-standing relationships with our domestic mill suppliers and certain customers accelerating their purchases in advance of anticipated carbon steel and aluminum product price increases. Our same-store tons sold increased 5.6% compared to the first quarter of 2024, surpassing the industry-wide decline of 0.5% reported by the Metals Service Center Institute (“MSCI”). 

​

Our gross profit margin of 29.7% for the first quarter of 2025 was strong despite a decline from 31.0% in the first quarter of 2024. 

​

Earnings per diluted share were $3.74 and $5.23 for the first quarters of 2025 and 2024, respectively. Our lower earnings per share year-over-year is mainly due to lower metals prices despite record tons sold in the first quarter of 2025 and an 8% reduction in outstanding shares as a result of share repurchases in the past four quarters. 

​

Cash flow from operations of $64.5 million in the first quarter of 2025 decreased from $126.3 million in the first quarter of 2024 mainly due to lower net income, partially offset by a decrease in working capital investment. Seasonally, the first quarter typically requires the largest working capital investment of the four quarters. 

​

Returns to stockholders in the first quarter of 2025 totaled $318.4 million, comprised of $253.2 million of share repurchases and $65.2 million of cash dividends, which reflected a 9.1% increase in our regular quarterly dividend rate effective in the first quarter of 2025. 

​

Cash used in investing activities in the first quarter of 2025 were mainly comprised of organic growth activities related to capital expenditures of $86.9 million in the first quarter of 2025, which declined from $108.7 million in the first quarter of 2024. 

​

**Acquisitions**

​

 _2024 Acquisitions_

​

We acquired each of Cooksey Iron & Metal Company on February 1, 2024; American Alloy Steel, Inc. and Mid-West Materials, Inc. on April 1, 2024; and certain assets of the FerrouSouth division of Ferragon Corporation on August 16, 2024, with cash on hand. Included in our net sales for the first quarters of 2025 and 2024 were combined net sales of $99.4 million and $16.1 million, respectively, from our 2024 acquisitions.

(1)  Gross profit, calculated as net sales less cost of sales, and gross profit margin, calculated as gross profit divided by net sales, are non-GAAP financial measures as they exclude depreciation and amortization expense associated with the corresponding sales. About half of our orders are basic distribution with no processing services performed. For the remainder of our sales orders, we perform “first-stage” processing, which is generally not labor intensive as we are simply cutting the metal to size. Because of this, the amount of related labor and overhead, including depreciation and amortization, is not significant and is excluded from cost of sales. Therefore, our cost of sales is substantially comprised of the cost of the material we sell. We use gross profit and gross profit margin as shown above as measures of operating performance. Gross profit and gross profit margin are important operating and financial measures as their fluctuations can have a significant impact on our earnings. Gross profit and gross profit margin, as presented, are not necessarily comparable with similarly titled measures for other companies.

​

We grew our same-store tons sold and our total tons sold increased to a new quarterly record, surpassing the declining trend in industry shipments as reported by the MSCI. Our record tons sold benefited from solid organic growth, supported by healthy underlying demand in the majority of our end markets, our availability of metals products, contributions from our 2024 acquisitions, and some customers accelerating purchases in advance of anticipated higher metal prices from announced tariffs in March 2025. 

​

Our net sales declined year-over-year due to declines in major commodity selling prices which outweighed record tons sold. Since we primarily purchase and sell our inventories in the spot market, our average selling prices generally fluctuate with the changes in replacement costs of the various metals we purchase. The mix of products sold can also have an impact on our average selling price per ton sold. As carbon steel sales represented 53% of our gross sales for the first quarter of 2025, changes in carbon steel prices have the most significant impact on changes in our average selling price per ton sold. 

​

The mix of our total sales by major commodity products and year-over-year changes in selling prices are presented below:

​

The decrease in cost of sales was attributable to a lower average cost per ton sold, mainly due to declines in replacement costs for carbon steel products, partially offset by an increase in tons sold. 

​

Gross profit decreased from the first quarter of 2024 mainly due to a lower average selling price per ton sold that outweighed record tons sold, and to a lesser extent a decrease in gross profit margin. 

​

We record, in cost of sales, non-cash adjustments to our LIFO method inventory valuation reserve that, in effect, reflects cost of sales at current replacement costs. The inventory caption of our consolidated balance sheet includes a LIFO method inventory valuation reserve of $459.9 million as of March 31, 2025.

​

Our gross profit margin declined from elevated levels in the first quarter of 2024, but remained at a strong level, as our average selling price per ton sold troughed mid-quarter and improved in March to prices that were higher than when the quarter began. Although our major commodity selling prices were higher in the first quarter of 2024, they declined throughout the quarter, which resulted in $50.0 million of LIFO income that increased gross profit margin. In the first quarter of 2025, our major commodity selling prices increased which resulted in $25.0 million of LIFO expense that lowered gross profit margin.

​

Our same-store SG&A expense in the first quarter of 2025 decreased slightly compared to the first quarter of 2024 mainly due to lower incentive-based compensation, resulting from lower profitability, offset by higher costs associated with wage inflation and increased headcount related to our organic growth activities. SG&A expense as a percentage of sales increased due to a lower average selling price per ton sold; however, operational leverage improved as SG&A expense per ton sold declined nearly 6%.

​

Operating income declined due to lower gross profit, driven by lower metals pricing and gross profit margin, that outweighed an increase in same-store tons sold, improved operational leverage, and contributions from our 2024 acquisitions. Our operating income margin declined as a result of a lower average selling price per ton sold and gross profit margin that outweighed improved operational leverage. 

​

See _“Net Sales”_ above for discussion of trends in demand and product costs and _“Expenses”_ for trends in our operating expenses. 

​

 _Income Tax Rate_

​

Our effective income tax rates for the first quarters of 2025 and 2024 were 23.6% and 23.3%, respectively. The differences between our effective income tax rates and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0% were mainly due to state income taxes. 

​

**Financial Condition**

​

 _Operating Activities_

​

Net cash provided by operations of $64.5 million in the first quarter of 2025 decreased $61.8 million from $126.3 million in the first quarter of 2024. The decrease was mainly due to a $103.3 million decline in net income, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities. Changes in operating assets and liabilities (exclusive of acquisitions) used cash of $223.4 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared to $256.9 million in the first quarter of 2024. 

​

 _Investing Activities_

​

Net cash used in investing activities of $87.6 million in the first quarter of 2025 decreased $89.8 million from $177.4 million in the first quarter of 2024. The decrease was mainly due to $53.7 million spent on an acquisition in the first quarter 

20

Table of Contents

of 2024 and a $21.8 million decrease in capital expenditures. The majority of our capital expenditures in the first quarters of 2025 and 2024 were related to growth activities. 

​

 _Financing Activities_

​

Net cash used in financing activities of $18.6 million in the first quarter of 2025 decreased $71.7 million from $90.3 million in the first quarter of 2024. The decrease was mainly the result of increased net debt borrowings on our revolving credit facility, partially offset by increased share repurchases. Net debt borrowings were $330.0 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared to no net debt borrowings in the first quarter of 2024. In the first quarter of 2025, we repurchased $253.2 million of our common stock compared to no repurchases in the first quarter of 2024. Our returns to stockholders also included a 9.1% increase in our quarterly dividend rate in February 2025; however, our total dividend payments of $65.2 million in the first quarter 2025 were lower than the $65.3 million paid in the first quarter of 2024 as a result of an approximately 8% reduction in our outstanding common shares from share repurchases in the past four quarters. 

​

On April 21, 2025, our Board of Directors declared the 2025 second quarter cash dividend of $1.20 per share. We have increased our quarterly dividend 32 times since our 1994 IPO, with the most recent increase of 9.1% from $1.10 to $1.20 per share effective in the first quarter of 2025. We have paid quarterly cash dividends on our common stock for 66 consecutive years and have never reduced or suspended our regular quarterly dividend.

​

 _Share Repurchase Plan_

​

See _Note 10—“Equity_ ” to our consolidated financial statements for information on our share repurchases.

​

As of April 25, 2025, we had remaining authorization to repurchase $1.02 billion of our common stock under our $1.5 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors on October 22, 2024. The share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares in any prescribed period, does not have a specific expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. 

​

 _Debt_

​

We have a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with $330.0 million of outstanding borrowings as of March 31, 2025 compared to no outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2024. We also have an aggregate of $1.15 billion principal amount of senior unsecured note obligations with various maturities through 2036 issued under indentures, including $400.0 million of senior notes due in August 2025.

​

See _Note 7—“Debt_ ” to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our amended credit agreement and indentures governing our debt securities.

​

 _Liquidity and Capital Resources_

​

We believe our primary sources of liquidity, including funds generated from operations, cash and cash equivalents and our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements and stockholder return activities over the next 12 months and beyond. As of March 31, 2025, we had $277.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and our net debt-to-total capital ratio was 14.4%, up from 10.2% as of December 31, 2024.

​

As of March 31, 2025, we had $401.1 million of debt obligations coming due before our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility matures on September 10, 2029, including $400.0 million of senior notes due in August 2025. 

​

We believe that we will continue to have sufficient liquidity to fund our future operating needs and to repay our debt obligations as they become due. In addition to funds generated from operations and approximately $1.17 billion available for borrowing on our unsecured revolving credit facility, we expect to continue to be able to access the capital markets to raise funds, if desired. We believe our investment grade credit ratings enhance our ability to effectively raise capital. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations, make necessary capital expenditures, finance strategic growth through acquisitions and internal initiatives, pay dividends and repurchase our common stock.

​

 _Covenants_

​

The Credit Agreement and indentures governing our debt securities include customary representations, warranties, covenants and events of default provisions. The covenants under the Credit Agreement include, among other things, a financial maintenance covenant that requires us to comply with a maximum total net leverage ratio. 

​

We were in compliance with the financial maintenance covenant under our Credit Agreement as of March 31, 2025.

​

**Seasonality**

​

Some of our customers are in seasonal businesses, especially customers in the construction industry and related businesses. Our overall operations have not shown any material seasonal trends as a result of our geographic, product and customer diversity. Typically, revenues in the months of July, November and December have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of working days for shipments of our products, resulting from holidays observed by the Company as well as vacation and extended holiday closures at some of our customers. The number of shipping days in each quarter also has an impact on our quarterly sales and profitability. We cannot predict whether period-to-period fluctuations will be consistent with historical patterns. Results of any one or more quarters are therefore not necessarily indicative of annual results.

​

**Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets**

​

Goodwill, which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired, amounted to $2.17 billion as of March 31, 2025, or approximately 21% of total assets and 30% of total equity. Additionally, other intangible assets, net amounted to $997.0 million as of March 31, 2025, or approximately 10% of total assets and 14% of total equity. Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests and further evaluation when certain events occur. Other intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We review the recoverability of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. 

​

**Critical Accounting Estimates**

​

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. When we prepare these consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Some of our accounting policies are critical due to the fact that they involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our most critical accounting estimates include those related to the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, and long-lived assets. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

​

During the quarter ended March 31, 2025, there were no material changes to our critical accounting estimates as compared to the critical accounting estimates disclosed in _Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations_ contained in _Part II, Item 7_ of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.

​

Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), an evaluation was performed on the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to and as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
