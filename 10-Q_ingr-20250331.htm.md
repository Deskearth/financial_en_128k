1\. Basis of Presentation and New Accounting Standards

Unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to the “Company,” “Ingredion,” “we,” “us,” and “our” shall mean Ingredion Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. These statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements contained in Ingredion’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. The significant accounting policies and estimates used in preparing these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements were applied on the same basis and consistent with those reflected in Ingredion’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.

The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2025 and for the first quarter of March 31, 2025 and 2024 included herein were prepared by us on the same basis as our audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2024 and reflect all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring items unless otherwise noted) that are, in our opinion, necessary for the fair presentation of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Equity and Redeemable Equity, and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The results for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year or any other future period.

New Accounting Standards

In August 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2023-05, Business Combinations - Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60). This ASU requires that a joint venture apply a new basis of accounting upon formation. By applying a new basis of accounting, a joint venture, upon formation, will recognize and initially measure its assets and liabilities at fair value (with exceptions to fair value measurement that are consistent with the business combinations guidance). This ASU is effective prospectively for all joint venture formations with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025. A joint venture that was formed before January 1, 2025 may elect to apply the amendments retrospectively. We adopted this ASU at the beginning of our 2025 fiscal year on a prospective basis.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This ASU requires public business entities on an annual basis to disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. Additionally, this ASU requires information pertaining to taxes paid (net of refunds received) to be disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes with further disaggregation for specific jurisdictions to the extent the related amounts exceed a quantitative threshold. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the impact of this ASU on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosure (Subtopic 220-40). The amendments in this update enhance disclosures about a public business entity’s expenses and provide more detailed information about the types of expenses included in certain notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the impact of this ASU on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

  
2. Divestitures

South Korea Divestiture

On February 1, 2024, we completed the sale of our South Korea business, which we reported in All Other, for a total consideration of 384 billion South Korean won, or approximately $294 million. As a result, we recognized a pre-tax net gain of $82 million during the first quarter of 2024 within Net gain on sale of business in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and received 330 billion South Korean won, or $247 million net of certain transaction costs. During the first quarter of 2025, we received the first annual consideration payment of 18 billion South Korean won, or

4. Fair Value Measurements

We measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the “exit price”) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, we use various valuation approaches. The hierarchy of those valuation approaches is in three levels based on the reliability of inputs. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Below is a summary of the hierarchy levels:

•Level 1 inputs consist of quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 2 inputs are based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.

•Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.

The carrying values of cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, short-term borrowings and accounts payable approximate fair values. Commodity futures, options and swap contracts are recognized at fair value. Foreign currency forwards, options and swap contracts are also recognized at fair value. The fair value of our Long-term debt is estimated based on quotations of major securities dealers who are market makers in the securities.

We maintain a commercial paper program under which we may issue senior unsecured notes of short-term maturities up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion outstanding at any time. The notes may be sold from time to time on customary terms in the U.S. commercial paper market. We use the note proceeds for general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, there was no commercial paper outstanding. During the first quarter of 2024, the average amount of commercial paper outstanding was $118 million with an average interest rate of 5.51 percent and a weighted average maturity of eight days. The amount of commercial paper outstanding under this program for the remainder of 2025 may fluctuate.

Other short-term borrowings as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 primarily include amounts outstanding under various unsecured local country operating lines of credit.

We anticipate that we will make cash contributions of $1 million and $2 million to the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans in 2025. For the first quarter of 2025, we made an insignificant cash contribution to the U.S. pension plans and $1 million to the non-U.S. pension plans.

During the first quarter of 2025 and 2024, the net periodic benefit cost for the postretirement plans consisted of $1 million of interest costs and no services costs.

7\. Equity

Treasury Stock: On September 26, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to purchase up to 6.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock until December 31, 2025. We may repurchase shares from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise, at prices we deem appropriate. We are not obligated to repurchase any shares under the authorization, and the repurchase program may be suspended, discontinued, or modified at any time, for any reason and without notice. The parameters of our stock repurchase program are not established solely with reference to the dilutive impact of shares issued under our stock incentive plan. However, we expect that, over time, share repurchases will offset the dilutive impact of shares issued under the stock incentive plan.

During the first quarter of 2025, we repurchased 409 thousand outstanding shares of common stock in open market transactions at a net cost of $55 million. During the first quarter of 2024, we repurchased 5 thousand outstanding shares of common stock in open market transactions at a net cost of $1 million.

Stock Options: Under our stock incentive plan, stock options are granted at exercise prices that equal the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The options have a 10-year term and are exercisable upon vesting, which occurs over a 3-year period at the anniversary dates of the date of grant. We generally recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis for all awards over the employee’s vesting period. We estimate a forfeiture rate at the time of grant and update the estimate throughout the vesting period of the stock options within the amount of compensation costs recognized in each period.

We granted non-qualified options to purchase 158 thousand shares and 178 thousand shares for the first quarter of 2025 and 2024. We estimated the fair value of each option grant by using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:

Expected life (in years)    5.5                             5.5    
Risk-free interest rate     4.1%                            4.2%   
Expected volatility         28.2%                           28.1%  
Expected dividend yield     2.5%                            2.9%   

The expected life of options represents the weighted average period that we expect options granted to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the grant date for the period corresponding to the expected life of the options. Expected volatility is based on historical volatilities of our common stock, and dividend yields are based on our dividend yield at the date of issuance.

For the first quarter of 2025, cash received from the exercise of stock options was $2 million. As of March 31, 2025, the unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options totaled $6 million, which we expect to amortize over the weighted-average period of approximately 1.4 years.

Additional information pertaining to stock option activity was as follows:

Restricted Stock Units: We have granted restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to certain key employees. The RSUs are primarily subject to cliff vesting, generally after 3 years, provided the employee remains in our service. The fair value of the RSUs is determined based upon the number of shares granted and the quoted market price of our common stock at the grant date.

RSU activity for 2025 was as follows:

As of March 31, 2025, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs was $32 million, which will be amortized on a weighted-average basis over approximately 2.0 years.

Performance Shares: We have a long-term incentive plan for senior management in the form of performance shares. The vesting of the performance shares is generally based on two performance metrics. Fifty percent of the performance shares awarded vest based on our total shareholder return as compared to the total shareholder return of our peer group, and the remaining fifty percent vest based on the calculation of our three-year average Adjusted Return on Invested Capital (“Adjusted ROIC”) against an established ROIC target.

For the 2025 performance shares awarded based on our total shareholder return, the number of shares that ultimately vest can range from zero to 200 percent of the grant depending on our total shareholder return as compared to the total shareholder return of our peer group. The share award vesting will be calculated at the end of the three-year period and is subject to approval by management and the People, Culture, and Compensation Committee (“Compensation Committee”) of the Board of Directors. Compensation expense is based on the fair value of the performance shares at the grant date, established using a Monte Carlo simulation model. We amortize the total compensation expense for these awards over a three-year graded vesting schedule.

For the 2025 performance shares awarded based on Adjusted ROIC, the number of shares that ultimately vest can range from zero to 200 percent of the grant depending on our Adjusted ROIC performance against the target. The share award vesting will be calculated at the end of the three-year period and is subject to approval by management and the Compensation Committee. We base compensation expense on the market price of our common stock on the grant date and the final number of shares that ultimately vest. We estimate the potential share vesting at least annually to adjust the compensation expense for these awards over the vesting period to reflect our estimated Adjusted ROIC performance against the target. We amortize the total compensation expense for these awards over a three-year graded vesting schedule.

For the first quarter of 2025, we awarded 82 thousand performance shares at a weighted average fair value of $145.73 per share. As of March 31, 2025, the unrecognized compensation cost related to these awards was $21 million, which we will amortize over the remaining service period of 2.4 years. The 2022 performance share awards that vested in February 2025 achieved a 200 percent payout of the granted performance shares. As of March 31, 2025, we estimated the 2023 performance share awards will pay out at 200 percent.

(i)Incremental shares from assumed exercise of dilutive stock options, vesting of dilutive stock options, vesting of dilutive RSUs and other awards.

For the first quarter of 2025 and 2024, approximately 0.1 million and 0.5 million share-based awards of common stock were excluded from the calculation of the weighted average number of shares outstanding for diluted EPS because their effects were anti-dilutive.

8. Segment Information

We are principally engaged in the production and sale of starches and sweeteners for a wide range of industries. Our T&HS segment has a global focus and primarily manufactures texturizing food ingredients. Our F&II - LATAM segment has a local focus and primarily manufactures food, ingredient, and industrial products, which we process from raw materials that we primarily source within South America and Mexico. Our F&II - U.S./Canada segment has a local focus and primarily manufactures food, ingredient, and industrial products, which we process from raw materials sourced within the U.S. and Canada. All Other consists of the businesses of multiple operating segments that are not individually or collectively classified as reportable segments. Net sales from All Other are generated primarily by sweetener and starch sales by our Pakistan business, sales of stevia and other ingredients from our PureCircle and Sugar Reduction businesses, and pea protein ingredients from our Protein Fortification business. We divested our South Korea business on February 1, 2024 and its results are included in our consolidated financial results through the date of sale, which affects the comparability of results between years within All Other. Net sales by product are not presented because such presentation is not practicable. 

Adjusted operating income presented by segment includes an arms-length profit margin for sales of manufactured products sold to other segments. We exclude specified and certain corporate items from our reportable segments and All Other because the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) evaluates each segment’s performance exclusive of these items.

Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

(dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted)

9\. Commitments and Contingencies

In December 2022, we filed an action in Brazil to recover previously taxable local government tax incentives. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we had $30 million and $39 million of remaining tax incentives, which decreased due to the utilization of the tax credits for the payment of income tax. A portion of these credits is expected to be used within one year. As of March 31, 2025, $25 million was recorded in Accounts receivable, net and $5 million in Other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Supply Chain Finance Programs

Under supply chain finance programs administered by third-party banks, our suppliers have the opportunity to sell receivables due from us to participating financing institutions and receive earlier payment at a discount. Our responsibility is limited to making payment on the terms originally negotiated with our supplier, regardless of whether such supplier sells its receivable to a financial institution. The payment terms we negotiate with a supplier are independent of whether such supplier participates in a supply chain finance program, and participation in any such program by a supplier has no effect on our income or cash flows.

As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, participating financial institutions held $148 million and $135 million of our liabilities recorded in Accounts payable and Accrued liabilities and liabilities held for sale in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of March 31, 2025, supply chain finance programs existed for operations in the U.S., Brazil, Mexico, certain PureCircle entities, Colombia, Peru, Thailand and China.

The rollforward of our outstanding obligations confirmed as valid under our supply chain finance programs were as follows:

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, as used in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” the terms “the Company,” “Ingredion,” “we,” “us,” and “our” and similar terms refer to Ingredion Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report and with the audited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contained or implied in any forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements” at the end of this discussion.

Overview

We are a leading global ingredients solutions provider that transforms grains, fruits, vegetables and other plant-based materials into value-added ingredient solutions for the food, beverage, animal nutrition, brewing and industrial markets. Our innovative ingredient solutions help customers stay on trend with simple ingredients and other in-demand ingredients. We are organized into three reportable segments that consist of Texture & Healthful Solutions (“T&HS”), Food & Industrial Ingredients (“F&II”) - Latin America (“LATAM”), and F&II - U.S./Canada, as well as All Other.

In the first quarter of 2025, net sales and net income decreased in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same quarter last year by 4 percent and 9 percent, respectively, while operating income increased 30 percent. Excluding the effects of the sale of our South Korea business on February 1, 2024, net sales decreased 2 percent and net income increased by 38 percent reflecting lower price mix attributable to lower raw material costs and foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by increased volumes. Operating income increased from the first quarter of 2024, primarily due to volume growth and lower raw material costs.

Most of our products are made locally and sold locally. We sell the vast majority of our products to customers in the U.S., Mexico and Canada, where trade is governed by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (“USMCA”). Our operations in the U.S. source corn produced in the U.S., and our subsidiaries outside the U.S. utilize both supplies of corn from their local regions, as well as corn imported from other geographic areas, including the U.S. In response to escalating tariff actions, we have activated a tariff response hub to continually assess our fluid business environment so that we may work with customers to navigate the complexity in the most cost-effective and least-disruptive manner. Although our efforts to date have been successful, we continue to monitor changing tariff requirements and reciprocal actions, as well as indirect effects in the economic environment, which may adversely affect our operations.

Results of Operations

We have significant operations globally. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect the U.S. dollar amounts of our foreign subsidiaries’ net sales and expenses. For most of our foreign subsidiaries, the local foreign currency is the functional currency. Accordingly, net sales and expenses denominated in the functional currencies of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable average exchange rates for the period.

First Quarter of 2025

With Comparatives to First Quarter of 2024

Net sales. Net sales decreased 4 percent to $1,813 million for the first quarter of 2025 compared to $1,882 million for the first quarter of 2024. The decrease was due primarily to lower raw material costs, foreign exchange impacts and the impact of our South Korea business in the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by T&HS volume increases. 

Cost of sales. Cost of sales decreased 8 percent to $1,347 million for the first quarter of 2025 compared to $1,465 million for the first quarter of 2024. The decrease was due primarily to lower raw material and input costs, compared to the same quarter last year. As a result, gross profit margin increased to 26 percent for the first quarter of 2025 from 22 percent for the first quarter of 2024.

Operating expenses. Operating expenses increased 2 percent to $193 million for the first quarter of 2025 compared to $189 million for the first quarter of 2024,. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11 percent for the first quarter of 2025 and 10 percent for the first quarter of 2024.

* * *

  

Other operating (income) expense. Other operating income was $10 million for the first quarter of 2025 compared to other operating expense of $12 million for the first quarter of 2024. The change was primarily due to earnings in our Argentina joint venture during the first quarter of 2025 compared to losses during the first quarter 2024 reflecting the impact from the devaluation of the Argentine currency. 

Restructuring/impairment charges. Restructuring/impairment charges increased to $7 million for the first quarter of 2025 compared to $3 million for the first quarter of 2024. The increase primarily relates to impairment charges related to certain equity investments recorded during the first quarter of 2025. During the first quarter of 2024, we recorded restructuring charges due to the resegmentation of the business effective January 1, 2024.

Financing costs. Financing costs decreased 53 percent to $9 million for the first quarter of 2025 compared to $19 million for the first quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to lower average outstanding debt balances for the first quarter of 2025 compared to the first quarter of 2024.

Net gain on sale of business. Net gain on sale of business was $82 million for the first quarter of 2024 to reflect the sale of our South Korea business, which was completed on February 1, 2024.

Provision for income taxes. Our effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2025 and 2024 was 25.5 percent and 21.0 percent. The increase was primarily due to favorable tax treatment on the sale of our South Korea business in the first quarter of 2024.

Net income attributable to Ingredion. Net income attributable to Ingredion for the first quarter of 2025 decreased to $197 million from $216 million for the first quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the $82 million gain on the sale of our South Korea business in the first quarter of 2024.

Segment Results

Texture & Healthful Solutions

Net sales. T&HS net sales increased to $602 million for the first quarter of 2025 compared to $597 million for the first quarter of 2024. Net sales increased primarily due to volumes, partially offset by unfavorable price mix.

Operating income. T&HS operating income increased 34 percent to $99 million for the first quarter of 2025 from $74 million for the first quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily due to lower raw material and input costs and increased volumes, partially offset by unfavorable price mix.

Food & Industrial Ingredients - LATAM

Net sales. F&II - LATAM net sales decreased 7 percent to $573 million for the first quarter of 2025 from $616 million for the first quarter of 2024. Net sales decreased primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, primarily in Brazil, and lower volumes.

Operating income. F&II - LATAM operating income increased 26 percent to $127 million for the first quarter of 2025 from $101 million for the first quarter of 2024. The quarter’s results benefited from the lapping of the devaluation of the Argentine peso on prior year results of our Argentina joint venture. Excluding the joint venture’s results, segment operating income increased due to lower raw material costs that were partially offset by lower volumes.

Food & Industrial Ingredients - U.S./Canada

Net sales. F&II - U.S./Canada net sales decreased 4 percent to $520 million for the first quarter of 2025 from $541 million for the first quarter of 2024. Net sales decreased primarily due to unfavorable price mix due to lower raw material costs that we passed through to customers.

Operating income. F&II - U.S./Canada operating income increased 6 percent to $92 million for the first quarter of 2025 from $87 million for the first quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily due to lower raw material costs.

* * *

  

All Other

Net sales. All Other net sales decreased 8 percent to $118 million for the first quarter of 2025 from $128 million for the first quarter of 2024. Net sales decreased primarily due to the sale of our South Korea business on February 1, 2024. Excluding the sale of our South Korea business, net sales increased 13 percent.

Operating income (loss). All Other operating (loss) was $0 million for the first quarter of 2025 compared to $(4) million for the first quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily due to improvements in our plant-based protein business.

Liquidity and Cash Requirements

As of March 31, 2025, we had total available liquidity of $3.8 billion. Domestic liquidity of $1.5 billion consisted of $471 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1.0 billion available through our commercial paper program. The commercial paper program is backed by $1.0 billion of borrowing availability under a five-year revolving credit agreement.

As of March 31, 2025, we had international liquidity of $2.3 billion, consisting of $366 million of cash and cash equivalents and $9 million of short-term investments held by our operations outside the U.S., as well as $1.9 billion of unused operating lines of credit in foreign countries where we operate. As the parent company, we guarantee certain obligations of our consolidated subsidiaries. These guarantees totaled $34 million as of March 31, 2025. We believe that those consolidated subsidiaries will be able to meet their financial obligations as they become due.

As of March 31, 2025, we had total debt outstanding of $1.8 billion. Of our outstanding debt, $1.7 billion consists of senior notes that do not require principal repayment until 2026 through 2050. The weighted average interest rate on our total indebtedness was approximately 4.0 percent for the first quarter of 2025 and approximately 4.1 percent for the first quarter of 2024.

The principal source of our liquidity is our internally generated cash flow, which we supplement as necessary with our ability to borrow under our credit facilities and commercial paper program and to raise funds in the capital markets. We currently expect that our available cash balances, future cash flow from operations, access to debt markets and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program will provide us with sufficient liquidity to fund our anticipated capital expenditures, dividends and other operating, investing and financing activities for at least the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. Our future cash flow needs will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, cost of raw materials, changing working capital requirements, the timing and extent of our expansion into new markets, the timing of introductions of new products, potential acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies, continuing market acceptance of our new products and general economic and market conditions. We may need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to fund our needs for less predictable strategic initiatives, such as acquisitions. 

Net Cash Flows

Our cash provided by operating activities was $77 million for the first quarter of 2025 compared to cash provided by operating activities of $209 million for the first quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $223 million change in working capital resulting from increased trade accounts receivables due to reduced utilization of customer financing programs and higher volumes.

We used $92 million of cash for capital expenditures and mechanical stores purchases to update, expand and improve our facilities during the first quarter of 2025 compared to $65 million we applied during the first quarter of 2024 for the same purposes. Capital investment commitments for the remainder of 2025 are anticipated to be between $400 million and $450 million.

We used $154 million of cash for financing activities during the first quarter of 2025 compared to cash used for financing activities of $347 million for the first quarter of 2024. The difference was primarily reflected the absence of commercial paper borrowings during the first quarter of 2025 compared to $312 million net repayments of commercial paper during the first quarter of 2024. The impact of this was partially offset by an increase in payments of debt of $48 million net in during first quarter 2025 compared to $15 million of net proceeds during first quarter 2024 and an increase in repurchases of common stock to $55 million in the first quarter 2025 compared to $1 million in the first quarter 2024.

* * *

  

We declare and pay cash dividends to our common stockholders of record on a quarterly basis. Dividends paid, including those to non-controlling interests, was $52 million during the first quarter of 2025 compared to $51 million during the first quarter of 2024. The increase in dividend payments was due to an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.80 per share during the first quarter of 2025 from $0.78 per share during the first quarter of 2024. 

During the first quarter of 2025, we repurchased 409 thousand outstanding shares of common stock in open market transactions at a net cost of $55 million. During the first quarter of 2024, we repurchased 5 thousand outstanding shares of common stock at a net cost of $1 million. 

We have not provided foreign withholding taxes, state income taxes and federal and state taxes on foreign currency gains and losses on accumulated undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries because these earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. It is not practicable to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings. We do not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements.
